## Functional Requirements
The company aims to design a system that reduces customer service costs by implementing an automated solution to resolve user queries efficiently.

## High Level Design
I have implemented caching to store query results, reducing the overall cost of querying the LLM. Additionally, we use a vector database to store similar documents, enabling better context retrieval for user queries, which enhances the accuracy of LLM responses.
