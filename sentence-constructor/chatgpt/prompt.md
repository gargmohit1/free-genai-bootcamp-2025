### Sentence Construction Pattern:

1. **[Noun] + は + まだ + [Verb in て-form] + います。**  
   → "The [Noun] is still [Verb]."  
   - Example: **電気はまだついています。**  
     *(Denki wa mada tsuiteimasu.)*  
     → "The lights are still on."

2. **[Pronoun] + は + [Object] + を + [Verb (dictionary form)] + のを + 忘れましたか？**  
   → "Did [Pronoun] forget to [Verb] [Object]?"  
   - Example: **あなたはそれを消すのを忘れましたか？**  
     *(Anata wa sore o kesu no o wasuremashita ka?)*  
     → "Did you forget to turn them off?"

---

### Considerations and Next Steps:

- **Alternative Expressions:**  
  - Instead of **あなた (Anata)** for "you," use **君 (Kimi)** (casual) or omit it in natural speech.  
  - **それ (Sore)** can be omitted if context is clear.  

- **Verb Conjugations for Grammar Practice:**  
  - **忘れます (Wasuremasu)** → Polite form  
  - **忘れた (Wasureta)** → Casual past form  
  - **忘れませんでした (Wasuremasen deshita)** → Negative past form
