### Sentence Construction Pattern:  
**[Noun] + は + まだ + [Verb in て-form] + います。**  
→ "The [Noun] is still [Verb]."  

**[Verb in ます-form] + 忘れましたか？**  
→ "Did you forget to [Verb]?"  

---

### Consideration & Next Steps:  
- This sentence uses the **て-form + います** structure to indicate a continued state (lights are still on).  
- "Forget to do something" is expressed with **Verb + 忘れる**, forming **消し忘れる** (forget to turn off).  
- Try constructing similar sentences using this pattern, such as:  
  - "The TV is still on, did you forget to turn it off?" → **テレビはまだついています。消し忘れましたか？**
