Explanation:

電気はまだついていますね (Denki wa mada tsuite imasu ne): This part translates to "The lights are still on, aren't they?". The "ね (ne)" at the end adds a softer tone, seeking confirmation.
消し忘れましたか (Keshi wasuremashita ka): This translates to "Did you forget to turn them off?". It's a polite way to ask, using the past tense and the question particle "か (ka)".

                    Sentence Construction Patterns:

                    Subject + は/が + Topic + Predicate: This is a basic sentence pattern. "は" marks the topic and "が" marks the subject (often omitted).
                    Verb + ます/ました/ません/ませんでした + か？: This is the polite form for asking a question. "ました" is the past tense.
                    ～て ください: This means "please do ~". We won't use it in this translation, but it's good to know.
                    Japanese Translation:

                    電気はまだついています、あなたは消すのを忘れましたか？
                    (Denki wa mada tsuiteimasu, anata wa kesu no o wasuremashita ka?)

                    Explanation:

                    電気は (Denki wa): The lights (topic marker "は").
                    まだ (mada): Still.
                    ついています (tsuiteimasu): Are on (present continuous).
                    、(,): Comma.
                    あなたは (Anata wa): You (topic marker "は").
                    消すのを (kesu no o): Turning off (the "の" acts as a nominalizer, making "kesu" a noun-like object of the verb "wasuremashita").
                    忘れましたか？ (wasuremashita ka?): Did you forget? (past tense polite question).
                    Considerations and Next Steps:

                    Implied Subject: In Japanese, the subject "them" (referring to the lights) is often implied and doesn't need to be explicitly stated.
                    Polite Form: The sentence uses the polite "ます" form, which is appropriate for general conversation.
                    Particle "を" (o): The particle "を" marks the direct object of the verb "kesu" (to turn off). In this case, it's attached to "kesu no" making it the object of "wasuremashita".
                    Next Steps: Practice saying the sentence aloud. Try changing the tense (e.g., "The lights were still on..."). Learn other ways to ask questions in Japanese. Learn more vocabulary related to electricity and household items.

                    Subject + は/が + Topic + Predicate: Basic sentence structure.
                    Verb + ます/ました/ません/ませんでした + か？: Polite question form (present/past, affirmative/negative).
                    ～て ください (te kudasai): Please do ~. (Not used in this translation, but useful to know).
                    Noun + の (no): Nominalizer, turns a verb or adjective into a noun-like object.
                    3. Step-by-Step Sentence Construction:

                    "The lights are still on":  電気はまだついています (Denki wa mada tsuiteimasu)

                    電気 (denki): Lights (subject, marked by は)
                    まだ (mada): Still
                    ついている (tsuiteiru): Are on (present continuous, from the verb つく tsuku - to turn on/be on)
                    "Did you forget to turn them off?": あなたは消すのを忘れましたか？ (Anata wa kesu no o wasuremashita ka?)

                    あなたは (anata wa): You (topic, marked by は)
                    消すのを (kesu no o): Turning them off (消す kesu - to turn off, の no - nominalizer, を o - object marker)
                    忘れましたか？ (wasuremashita ka?): Did you forget? (from 忘れる wasureru - to forget, past tense polite form ました mashita, question marker か ka)
                    Putting it together: 電気はまだついています、あなたは消すのを忘れましたか？ (Denki wa mada tsuiteimasu, anata wa kesu no o wasuremashita ka?)

                    4. Verb Conjugations (忘れる - wasureru - to forget):

                    Present: 忘れます (wasuremasu) - I forget / You forget / He/She forgets / We forget / They forget
                    Past: 忘れました (wasuremashita) - I forgot / You forgot / etc.
                    Negative Present: 忘れません (wasuremasen) - I don't forget / You don't forget / etc.
                    Negative Past: 忘れませでした (wasuremasen deshita) - I didn't forget / You didn't forget / etc.
                    Te-form: 忘れて (wasurete) - For connecting clauses (e.g., 忘れてください - Please forget)
                    5. Example Sentences with Different Constructions:

                    Pronoun + Adjective: 彼は優しいです。(Kare wa yasashii desu.) - He is kind.
                    Verb + Noun: 食べるのが好きです。(Taberu no ga suki desu.) - I like eating. (Here, "taberu" becomes a noun-like object with "no ga")
                    Adjective + Noun: 新しい車が欲しいです。(Atarashii kuruma ga hoshii desu.) - I want a new car.
                    Pronoun + Verb + Object: 彼女に花をあげました。(Kanojo ni hana o agemashita.) - I gave her flowers.
                    6. Considerations and Next Steps:

                    Natural Speech: In casual conversation, the topic marker は (wa) is often omitted. So, you might hear 電気まだついてる？忘れちゃった？ (Denki mada tsuiteru? Wasurechatta?) - Lights are still on? Did you forget? (More casual)
                    Politeness Levels: The "ます" form is generally polite. There are even more polite forms (e.g., ～です desu/～ます masu) and more casual forms.
                    Practice: Practice saying the sentence aloud and writing it. Try changing the tense or adding other details. The best way to learn is through consistent practice.
