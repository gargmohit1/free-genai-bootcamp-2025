Explanation:

電気はまだついていますね (Denki wa mada tsuite imasu ne): This part translates to "The lights are still on, aren't they?". The "ね (ne)" at the end adds a softer tone, seeking confirmation.
消し忘れましたか (Keshi wasuremashita ka): This translates to "Did you forget to turn them off?". It's a polite way to ask, using the past tense and the question particle "か (ka)".

                    Sentence Construction Patterns:

                    Subject + は/が + Topic + Predicate: This is a basic sentence pattern. "は" marks the topic and "が" marks the subject (often omitted).
                    Verb + ます/ました/ません/ませんでした + か？: This is the polite form for asking a question. "ました" is the past tense.
                    ～て ください: This means "please do ~". We won't use it in this translation, but it's good to know.
                    Japanese Translation:

                    電気はまだついています、あなたは消すのを忘れましたか？
                    (Denki wa mada tsuiteimasu, anata wa kesu no o wasuremashita ka?)

                    Explanation:

                    電気は (Denki wa): The lights (topic marker "は").
                    まだ (mada): Still.
                    ついています (tsuiteimasu): Are on (present continuous).
                    、(,): Comma.
                    あなたは (Anata wa): You (topic marker "は").
                    消すのを (kesu no o): Turning off (the "の" acts as a nominalizer, making "kesu" a noun-like object of the verb "wasuremashita").
                    忘れましたか？ (wasuremashita ka?): Did you forget? (past tense polite question).
                    Considerations and Next Steps:

                    Implied Subject: In Japanese, the subject "them" (referring to the lights) is often implied and doesn't need to be explicitly stated.
                    Polite Form: The sentence uses the polite "ます" form, which is appropriate for general conversation.
                    Particle "を" (o): The particle "を" marks the direct object of the verb "kesu" (to turn off). In this case, it's attached to "kesu no" making it the object of "wasuremashita".
                    Next Steps: Practice saying the sentence aloud. Try changing the tense (e.g., "The lights were still on..."). Learn other ways to ask questions in Japanese. Learn more vocabulary related to electricity and household items.
