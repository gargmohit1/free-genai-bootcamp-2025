Explanation:

電気はまだついていますね (Denki wa mada tsuite imasu ne): This part translates to "The lights are still on, aren't they?". The "ね (ne)" at the end adds a softer tone, seeking confirmation.
消し忘れましたか (Keshi wasuremashita ka): This translates to "Did you forget to turn them off?". It's a polite way to ask, using the past tense and the question particle "か (ka)".
